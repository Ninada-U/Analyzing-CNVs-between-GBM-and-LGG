The URL to this website is https://ninada-u.github.io/Analyzing-CNVs-between-GBM-and-LGG/

By Yifei Ning, Siqi Huang, and Noah Inada



The intended audience for this webpage is those with basic knowledge of biology/genetics - e.g. highschool or college graduates. We discuss the brain cancer Glioblastoma Multiforme and brain tumors low-grade gliomas. We also discuss Copy Number Variation, a form of genetic variation. The outline of our website will be structured similar to our elevator pitch, maybe with images and more details.

We have not confirmed our visualizations yet, but right now we may go with:

- A heatmap comparing the CNVs of those with Glioblastoma Multiforme and those with a low-grade glioma
- Manhattan plots and/or concordance-at-the-top plots also comparing the CNVs between the two populations

We may also include some Python and R `code`.
