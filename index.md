The website will have a story telling feature. We will assume the audience is the general public, so we will have a introduction section, a background section, a modeling section, a viz section, and a Q&A section. In this way, we could effectively communicate with our target audience and the audience could also interact with the features in the websites. The websites will be static since we would not be using a lot of database to store the data. We plan to build our website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This version is a rough draft of the final web.

Here are heatmaps of array-array intensity comparing the CNVs of those with Glioblastoma Multiforme and those with a low-grade glioma. Included are boxplots of correlation samples by samples after normalization of the two populations.
