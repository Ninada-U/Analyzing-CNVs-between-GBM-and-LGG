# Genetic Differences Between Glioblastoma Multiforme and Low-Grade Glioma Populations: How Does Copy Number Variation Distinguish Each Disease?

### The goal of this project is to identify genetic differences between glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and low-grade glioma (LGG) populations. This is important because these genetic differences may be useful for diagnosing these diseases in people. This was done by comparing each population’s copy number variation focal scores. Our project’s question is: How does copy number variation of GBM and LGG distinguish each disease? Our hypothesis is that the GBM population will have more copy number variation because GBM is more malignant, and so has more genetic mutations.

### In comparing the focal scores it was found that the GBM population had 1.5 times more duplications and deletions than the LGG population, confirming our hypothesis. And, there were specific sets of outlying genes in the GBM population that distinguish it from the LGG population - but only on a cross-case analysis level. Practically, it is not applicable to use them as markers for diagnosis. This project confirms the hypothesis that GBM has more genetic variation in its copy number variation, but does not support the approach to use copy number variation as a method of diagnosing either disease.
